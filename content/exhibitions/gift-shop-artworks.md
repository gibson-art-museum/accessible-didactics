    description: "Antonia Hirsch's practice is concerned with the systems—whether spatial, linguistic, or quantitative—that structure understandings of our universe. Her work often relates such ordering systems to embodied and visual experience, considering how these representational systems, which are open to multiple interpretations and often ideological in nature, are expressed through a level of abstraction.mobilemobile II is part of a series of kinetic sculptures using the screen forms of Apple Macintosh's 2015 mobile devices: iPhone 5, iPhone 6, iPhone 6s, iPad mini 4, and iPad Air 2. Hirsch describes these works as attentive to the form and raw materiality of consumer electronics and communication technology. Screens form a central motif in her work. She notes that as handheld devices, we carry them close to our bodies. As such, they can be seen as interfaces between ostensible opposites: the inner world of emotions and the outer sphere of the social and political. Perhaps most compellingly, as commodities, mobile devices carry a kind of aura, thereby aligning them with the categories of the artwork and the lucky charm: material things with an immaterial power and agency."
