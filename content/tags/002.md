Created in 1931, this surrealist masterpiece features melting pocket watches draped over a barren landscape. The painting explores themes of time, memory, and the subconscious mind.

The soft, melting watches contrast sharply with the hard, angular cliffs in the background, creating a dreamlike quality that became Dalí's signature style. A strange, fleshy creature lies in the center of the composition, with a watch melting over its back.

## Symbolism

The melting watches represent the fluidity and unreliability of time in our dreams and memories. Dalí was inspired by the surrealist idea of the "dream photograph" - capturing the impossible logic of dreams in painted form.

## Technical Details

Oil on canvas, 24 cm × 33 cm. Part of the permanent collection at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.

The small size of the painting contrasts with its enormous cultural impact, making it one of the most recognizable images of the 20th century.
