This iconic painting from 1889 depicts a swirling night sky over a small French village. Van Gogh painted it from memory during his stay at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence.

The painting features dramatic, swirling clouds and stars that seem to dance across the sky, with a prominent crescent moon in the upper right. A dark cypress tree rises from the foreground like a flame, connecting the earth to the turbulent sky above.

The village below appears peaceful and still, with small houses and a church steeple, providing a stark contrast to the dynamic energy of the heavens.
